For tests that use this mesasge to work, it must contain spammy phrases,
the body must be at least 2048 bytes long, the first 1024 bytes of the
body must remain unchanged, the last line must remain unchanged and
the very first line of this file must remain unchanged.

Subject to those constraints you can add spammy stuff at the end of this
message as long as you add it after the first 1024 bytes of the body and
before the last line.

Some tests scripts hard code the SHA1 hash of the first 1024 bytes of this
message which is why you must not alter those first 1024 bytes.

The hash is actually calculated on the minimum of 1024 and half the length
of the body of the message, which is why the body of this message has to be
at least 2048 bytes.

Another test script checks for the first line and the last line of this file.

Enough filler, now for the spammy stuff:
