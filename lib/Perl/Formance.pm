=head1 NAME

Perl::Formance - Perl Performance Benchmark Suite

=head1 ABOUT

This benchmark suite tries to run some stressful programs and outputs
values that you can compare against other runs of this suite,
e.g. with other versions of Perl, modified compile parameter, or
another set of dependent libraries.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Perl::Formance;

    my $foo = Perl::Formance->new();

=head1 BUGS

=head2 No invariant dependencies

This distribution only contains the programs to run the tests and
according data. It uses a lot of libs from CPAN with all their
dependencies but it does not contain invariant versions of those used
dependency libs.

If total invariance is important to you, you are responsible to
provide that invariant environment by yourself. You could, for
instance, create a local CPAN mirror with CPAN::Mini and never upgrade
it. Then use that mirror for all your installations of Perl::Formance.

On the other side this could be used to track the performance of your
installation over time by continuously upgrading from CPAN.

=head2 It's not scientific

The benchmarks are basically just a collection of already existing
interesting things like large test suites found on CPAN or just
starting long running tasks that seem to stress perl features. It does
not really guarantee accuracy of only raw Perl features, i.e., it does
not care for underlying I/O speed and does not preallocate ressources
from the OS before using them, etc.

This is basically because I just wanted to start, even without
knowledge about "real" benchmark science.

Anyway, feel free to implement "real" benchmark ideas and send me
patches.
